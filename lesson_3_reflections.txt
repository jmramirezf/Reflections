When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to work in team with another people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because there are many people editing files and those changes are not necessary at all.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Cloning repositories is the way to get all files locally. We can commit changes in the origin repository. Fork is the way to get a repository but we cannot commit changes in the origin. 
A branch is an alternative version of the master branch.
